    TODO:
    - Revise Decaying Flesh, False Prayer, Portal Instability, and Weird Science, all of them don't really work too well
    - Revise Rich Tastes, turn it into a powerup mutation like Cheek Pouches, enemies pop into cash on death?
    - Refine Think Tank, it's a bit funky and could feel better if the chests were delayed somehow. also buggy
    - Turn sleep into a global effect
    - Add Dental Caps, Steel Wool, and Blood-shot Sclera
    - Revise Impact Wrists (?)
    - Revise quest system
